function H = drawCircleWedges(xc, yc, radius, wedges, colors)
%	usage:      H = drawCircleWedges (xc, yc, radius, wedges, colors)
%	purpose:	Draws a filled circle centered at (xc, yc) in drawing coordinates, and
%               with a radius of radius in drawing coordinates. The circle
%               will be divided into sections equal to 'wedges' each one
%               will be colored based on the colors in 'colors'.
%               Returns a handle to the circle being created. 
%   note:       colors is an array of colors whose size is at least the
%               number of wedges
