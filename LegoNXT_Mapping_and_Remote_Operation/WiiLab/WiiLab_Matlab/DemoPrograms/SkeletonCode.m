%  Getting Started Program Demo
%  
%  This program is designed to give a new user the skeleton code to allow
%  them to easily and quickly begin using WiiLAB. The program contains all
%  the vital code that is needed to connect to and use the Wiimote along
%  with reserved sections for the user to add their code.

% Add the paths for the Wiimote and Graphics Functions
% These paths are assuming you are using the installer for WiiLAB that was
% provided. If you did not then change the paths to the location of the
% WiimoteFunctions and EG111-H folders on your computer
addpath C:\'Program Files'\Wiimote\WiiLAB_Matlab\WiimoteFunctions
addpath C:\'Program Files'\Wiimote\WiiLAB_Matlab\EG111-H

% YOUR CODE HERE
% Any graphics objects that will be used throughout your program should go
% here.
% For example, if you are creating an program that will use the Wiimote 
% to move a circle around the screen, you should create the circle here.
