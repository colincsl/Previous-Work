%  Getting Started Program Demo
%  
%  This program is designed to give a new user the skeleton code to allow
%  them to easily and quickly begin using WiiLAB. The program contains all
%  the vital code that is needed to connect to and use the Wiimote along
%  with reserved sections for the user to add their code.

% Add the paths for the Wiimote and Graphics Functions
% These paths are assuming you are using the installer for WiiLAB that was
% provided. If you did not then change the paths to the location of the
% WiimoteFunctions and EG111-H folders on your computer
addpath C:\'Program Files'\Wiimote\WiiLAB_Matlab\WiimoteFunctions
addpath C:\'Program Files'\Wiimote\WiiLAB_Matlab\EG111-H


% Connect to the Wiimote

% Create the graphics Window (optional but recommended)

% YOUR CODE HERE
% Any graphics objects that will be used throughout your program should go
% here.
% For example, if you are creating an program that will use the Wiimote 
% to move a circle around the screen, you should create the circle here.

% Create the object that will be controlled by the Wiimote's Acceleration
circle = drawCircle(150, 150, 5, 'black');

% Check to make sure the Wiimote is connected

    % Main program loop
    % Used for polling the Wiimote data
    % This loop will run until 'HOME' on the Wiimote is Pressed
    while(~isButtonPressed('HOME'))

        % The main portion of your program will go here.
        
        % First
        % Get the Wiimote's acceleration, They will be values between -9.8
        % and 9.8
        [x y z] = getWiimoteAccel();
        
        
        % Since we are working in only two dimensions, we are going to
        % ignore the z acceleration and use the x and y accelerations to
        % move the circle
        % We are going to treat the Wiimote's acceration as the circle's
        % velocity to keep the program simple.
        yMove(circle, y);
