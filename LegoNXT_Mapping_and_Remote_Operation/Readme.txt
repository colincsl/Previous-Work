To run properly everything should be unzipped to C:/NXT. WiiLAB must be installed before running the Matlab script.
The installer is in the main WiiLAB folder.

Everything in the matlab_legonxt folder was created by Mathworks and is available free online.

WiiLAB was written by students at Notre Dame University and is available for free at http://netscale.cse.nd.edu/twiki/bin/view/Edu/WiiMote.

Use Mapping_and_Remote_Operation.m to run the program.
